 I am a new webdesigner just starting out.  I have accidentally chanced upon github and even though it appears somewhat daunting I don't intend to give up until I have mastered this tool.
Hi Everyone, I just completed a page for my readers who view my project.  Please feel free to comment and offer suggestions where you believe they will be helpful.  Thank you.
